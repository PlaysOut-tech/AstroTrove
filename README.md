5.Core Gameplay
5.1 Regular Treasure Chest Hitting
In AstroTrove, treasure chests randomly appear on the screen, and players click to break them and earn rewards. The faster a chest is broken, the greater the reward. A player’s attack efficiency—determined by their Avatars level and progress plays a key role in maximizing rewards.
Treasure chests can drop gold coins, diamonds (from Elite chests), and various items. Gold coins can be used to draw rare, uncommon, and epic-level Avatars for added support, while diamonds unlock legendary and extraordinary-level Avatars to boost gameplay.
Players can break up to 500 treasure chests every 24 hours, but signing in on- chain increases this limit to 2,000 chests. 
Once the daily limit is reached, additional chests will no longer yield rewards, encouraging strategic play to maximize gains.

5.2 Elite Treasure Chest

In AstroTrove, every treasure chest broken earns the player Points. The stronger the chest, the more Points are awarded. Once a player accumulates 10,000 Points, an Elite treasure chest is guaranteed to appear. 

Breaking this chest yields gold coins, points, and exclusive rewards like diamonds, which are not found in ordinary chests. Diamonds are the sole currency used to unlock legendary Avatars, making them a highly coveted resource.

After an Elite treasure chest is broken, the Points counter resets (though the total Points still contribute to the leaderboard). Players can repeat this cycle, earning another Elite treasure chest each time they reach 10,000 Points, creating a thrilling loop of progression and rewards.         
5.3 Cross-Ecosystem Ranking List

AstroTrove introduces a groundbreaking cross-ecosystem ranking system, uniting players from diverse platforms like TON, Aptos, and BNB Chain on a mixed server. This fosters healthy competition across ecosystems, boosting player engagement and enhancing activity within each network.

The leaderboard determines the airdrop weight each player earns at the end of the season. The current version features two distinct ranking lists:

Point Ranking List: Tracks the total Points a player accumulates during the season by breaking treasure chests. Higher activity, greater combat power, and more chests broken result in a higher ranking.

Overall Power Ranking List: Reflects the player’s combat power, showcasing the strongest contenders across all ecosystems. The total combat power value is displayed in the game interface, offering a clear measure of competitive strength.

Together, these rankings create a dynamic system that rewards both active participation and strategic gameplay, highlighting the top performers in the AstroTrove universe
